# Employee Management Application – Engineering Thesis

This repository contains an engineering thesis project developed as part of undergraduate studies at the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology.

The project is a web-based employee management application designed for small and medium-sized enterprises. Its main goal is to support organizational and administrative processes by providing tools for managing employees, tasks, working time, evaluations, and company events within a single system.

The application includes modules such as task management, a company calendar, working time tracking, employee evaluations, user and group management, and administrative dashboards. The system was designed with scalability, security, and usability in mind, following modern software engineering principles.

The backend of the application is implemented using **.NET**, while the frontend is built with **Angular**. Communication between the client and server is handled via a REST API, and the system uses JWT-based authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access.

This project was created as part of an engineering thesis and demonstrates the practical application of modern web technologies, modular architecture, and best practices in software development.

# System not working without up to date database
If u consider using it, we recommend u create in memory database for test
